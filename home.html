Young (accounting firm) are responsible for confirming the winner • whatever team has that combination wins the #1 pick • Gary Bettman (NHL commissioner) verifies it and then announces it • Process repeats for next two lotteries • Lottery finished by 7:16 p.m. Eligibility • Any player who turns 18 by September 15th and not 20 by December 31st is eligible for drafting • A player who is not signed by the team that drafted him in 2 years can reenter the draft if eligible or become an Unrestricted Free Agent and the team who drafted him gets a compensation second round pick • If a player is not signed by age 20 they become an Unrestricted Free Agent NBA: Draft lottery • Current system is the #1, #2 and #3 picks are determined by lottery slotting machine • Ping-pong balls are selected from a machine in order to form four-digit combinations that have been assigned to each lottery team • Draft lottery started in 1985 • Top three picks have been in place since 1990 Before to now • Up until 1966 when the NBA revamped the system, teams could take a territorial pick • They could draft anyone in their team’s territory, but had to forfeit their first round pick • In 1966 teams drafted worst record to best and the #1 Pick was determined between the worst two teams with a coin flip • That system was in place until 1984 and was changed because people were speculating teams were deliberately losing their game to get a better draft pick • In 1985 a new system was enforced, it involved pulling random envelops from a hopper and that was how the order was determined • In 1990 the weighted lottery system was put in place and that is the current method the NBA uses • Currently 2 rounds Eligibility • Player must turn 19 on or before the calendar year of the draft • They must have completed four years of college eligibility • They have signed contract with professional team outside of the NBA and have played under that contract and they must be released from their contract before they can go to the NBA MLB Before to now • First draft was in June 1965 • Originally 3 drafts, one in June one in August and one in January • August draft eliminated in 1967 • January draft eliminated in 1986 • MLB used to assign minor league players to teams • Currently has 40 rounds • Goes in order of worst record to best record Draft Lottery • Goes in order of worst to best • If two teams have identical records the #1 pick is given to the team with the previous season worst record Eligibility • Must have attended an educational school in the United States or Canada • Have never signed a major or minor league contract • High school players must graduate before they can be drafted • Players in a four-year university or college must either finish three years or turn 21 to be able to be drafted • Junior and community players can be drafted at any time " data-orig-src="images/u251-1783.png?crc=3779101320" data-image-width="629" data-orig-id="u251-178" src="images/blank.gif?crc=4208392903"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
